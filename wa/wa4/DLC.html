    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>During my time at the Digital Legacy Clinic I was in a team with two other students. Our job was to build the website following the style guidelines from the University of Colorado Boulder in order to receive approval for the website to be published. The Digital Legacy Clinic is an online service only so the website would be the only way clients could learn more about the Digital Legacy Clinic and reach out for help by filling out the web form.</p>

    <h3>My Contribution</h3>
    <p>I conducted competitive analysis on other University of Colorado Boulder websites to understand what could be done using Web Express since the university required the Digital Legacy Clinic website to be built on Web Express and follow the university style guidelines. I used Miro Board to create a site map which led to our wire frame. We built out the design of the website's pages on figma making sure to follow the style guidelines. We had very limited time to build the website before the Digital Legacy Clinic launched. This meant we had to iterate while building the website. Our team worked on all the pages together asynchronously. I built the menus and the web form clients use to contact the clinic. I had to ensure the web form wouldn't let users submit without filling all the fields and sending the submitted forms to the ticket managing system. Throughout the whole process I was documenting the changes made to the website, design choices we made and keeping a list of bugs we encountered along with their solutions so anyone working on the website after my team would have an easy transition to work on the website.</p>
