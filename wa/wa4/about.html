    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a student in CU Boulder majoring in Information Science with a minor in Creative Technology & Design. I'm interested in how designs can make technology more approachable, inclusive and create a meaningful impact on people.</p>

    <p>I believe technology should make life easier, more inclusive and more engaging. That's why when I work on projects I value feedback from potential users and love collaborating with others to iterate on designs.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to continue learning more tools and gain more experience to ensure I can create designs many people will be able to use to better their experiences online</p>
