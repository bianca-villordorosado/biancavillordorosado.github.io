    <h2>OnTrack</h2>
    <p>Ideal for students who want an app to search for jobs using precise filters, apply to jobs faster and track completed job applications all in one app.</p>

    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>As we began our development process we had one important question in mind, how can we make an app that helps refine job hunting into a more organized, user friendly, and low stress process? With this question in mind, our goal was to separate ourselves from the competition by having an application tracker in the app, transparency on what step the user is on their application, real job listings, precise filters and clear signifies for important dates relating to the user's job search process.</p>

    <h3>My Contribution</h3>
    <p>I interviewed three students with the goal of answering three key themes, what is their current job search methods, biggest frustrations with the job search process and what they would desire in a job search app. We analyzed all our interviews together as well as the competitive analysis we all gathered. We made multiple personas with scenarios which led to our two storyboards and a journeymap. I worked on both of our low-fi prototypes using figma. I conducted two usability tests where participants had to do tasks relating to the job search process on both prototypes. Using the feedback we received I refined the design and helped create our med-fi prototype and conducted another usability test. After refining the design again I helped created our final version of the app.  I then scripted and recorded our app overview demo.</p>
