    <h2>Designing intuitive and meaningful digital experiences</h2>
    <p>I'm a User centered designer with a strong foundation in the design cycle, from research and wireframing to usability testing and iteration. Skilled in creating intuitive digital experiences through thoughtful visual designs that are accessible.</p>

    <p>I’m driven by a passion for designing digital experiences that are both intuitive and meaningful. I believe technology should make life easier, more inclusive, and more engaging. That’s why I’m drawn to UX/UI design.</p>

    <p>As an Information Science major with a minor in Creative Technology & Design at CU Boulder, I’m developing strong skills in user research, prototyping, and interaction design. I enjoy combining creativity with problem solving to bring ideas to life, and I’m always eager to learn new tools and use different approaches to achieve this.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite projects was helping design CU Boulder’s Digital Legacy Clinic website, a resource that supports the public in navigating their digital assets. This experience gave me the chance to apply user centered design principles to a real world project that makes an impact by helping others.</p>

    <p>I’m excited to continue growing as a designer and to contribute to projects that connect people with technology in thoughtful ways. You can explore the projects I've worked on the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
