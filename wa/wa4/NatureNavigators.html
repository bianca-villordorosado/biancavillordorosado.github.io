    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>Learning more about a plant or animal you encountered while on a hike can be difficult when you don't know their names, which is why we created Nature Navigators. The purpose of the app is to make learning about the local environment more accessible and engaging for hikers. The app also provides important information about trails. With this goal in mind our how might we question was: "How might we make nature education more accessible and engaging for hikers?"<p>

    <h3>Team Contribution and Timeline</h3>
    <p>This project was started in January 2025 and completed in April 2025. Our team consisted of four members. The members were Chris Arispe, Diana Romero, Lauren Ward and myself. We all worked together on the project presentation, journey map, user flowchart, app color palette, app typography, Figma prototype, and usability tests for our prototype. Chris created a survey to access what tools and methods hikers use to learn more about trails. Diana designed a paper prototype to get an idea of what features we would want to implement into our app and how the layout could potentially look like. Lauren interviewed hikers who were different in experience to better understand how engaged they were with their environment on their hikes. I observed hikers on a popular trail at a busy time over two hours to watch how hikers interacted with the environment and see if they read any trail signs that provided information about the trail/environment.</p>
